# Razer Mice Battery Check in MacOS Menu Bar

It's 2024 and on MacOS there's no way to check the battery status of Razer' Mice. That's kinda absurd, so here you go.

When it gets under 20% it sends a notification warning of low battery.

## How to install

1. Download app from [releases](https://github.com/AlexPerathoner/razer-battery-menu-bar-macos/releases/latest).
2. Move into `/Applications`
3. In System Settings > Login Elements, click on `+` and select `razer-battery-menu-bar.app` to open automatically on login.
